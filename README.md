# Demo for Pan-Universal Arms

This project was created as a demo for Pan-Universal Arms a fictious company that produces Star War weapons. This is a web app that will communicate with a back-end ERP service at a later date. That service is mocked out for now.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

## Initial Setup

1.  Make sure you are on node v8.9.4 (node -v) and npm v5.6.0 (npm -v). Recommended to use node version manager (nvm or nvm-windows).
2.  Pull pan-uni-arms and run `npm install -g @angular/cli` and `npm install`. For this project I used Angular 6.0.4 and angular cli 6.0.8 (ng -v).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Alternatively you can run `ng serve --open` this will automatically open up the default browser to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

_Reference:_ [@ngular/cli blueprints](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular/cli/README.md#generating-components-directives-pipes-and-services).

**Note:** You can also use the angular shortcuts `'g' for generator 'c' for component` and use the _blueprints_ aka `ng g c somethingcool --flat -d` etc.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
